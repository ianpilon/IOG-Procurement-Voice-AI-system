Optimal Questioning Techniques for Maximum Knowledge Transfer:
Use Story-Elicitation (Not Direct Questions)

❌ "What's your customer service protocol?"
✅ "Tell me about the last time a customer was really upset - walk me through what you did."

Ask for Specific Examples (Force Concrete Details)

Always follow up with: "Give me a specific example of when that happened"
Use: "Last time that occurred, what exactly did you do?"

Use Comparison Questions (Reveals Decision Criteria)

"Why did you choose supplier A over supplier B?"
"What makes customer X worth more effort than customer Y?"

Capture Negatives (Learn from Failures)

"What would you never do again?"
"What advice would you ignore if you started over?"

Document the Sequence (Get the Real Process)

"Walk me through your typical Monday morning routine"
"Show me exactly what you do when [X] happens"
