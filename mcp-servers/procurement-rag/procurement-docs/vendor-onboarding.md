# Vendor Onboarding Process

## Overview
All new vendors must complete the IOG vendor onboarding process before work can begin. This ensures compliance, risk mitigation, and proper vendor management.

## Step 1: Initial Vendor Assessment
Before engaging a new vendor, the requesting department must provide:
- Vendor name and contact information
- Description of services or products needed
- Estimated contract value
- Business justification
- Urgency/timeline

## Step 2: Vendor Risk Assessment
The procurement team will conduct a risk assessment based on:
- Contract value (contracts over $100K require enhanced due diligence)
- Type of service (IT services, consulting, physical goods, etc.)
- Data access requirements
- Geographic location
- Industry reputation

Risk levels:
- **Low Risk**: <$25K, no data access, established vendor
- **Medium Risk**: $25K-$100K, limited data access
- **High Risk**: >$100K, significant data access, new vendor

## Step 3: Required Documentation
All vendors must submit:

### Basic Requirements (All Vendors):
- W-9 form (US vendors) or W-8 form (international vendors)
- Certificate of Insurance (General Liability minimum $1M)
- Proof of business registration
- Banking information for payments

### Additional Requirements for Medium/High Risk:
- Financial statements (for contracts >$100K)
- Reference letters from previous clients (minimum 2)
- Security questionnaire (if handling IOG data)
- Background check authorization (for on-site vendors)

## Step 4: Legal Review
### Contracts Under $50K:
- Can use standard IOG contract templates
- Maria Santos (Procurement Specialist) can approve
- Typical turnaround: 3-5 business days

### Contracts $50K-$100K:
- Requires legal review of terms
- Andrea Smith (Procurement Manager) approval needed
- Typical turnaround: 5-10 business days

### Contracts Over $100K:
- Full legal review required
- CFO approval needed
- Board notification may be required
- Typical turnaround: 10-15 business days

## Step 5: Information Security Review
Required if vendor will:
- Access IOG systems or networks
- Handle IOG confidential data
- Store or process customer data
- Have physical access to IOG facilities

InfoSec team will:
- Review security controls
- Conduct security assessment
- Approve or require remediation
- Issue access credentials if approved

Turnaround time: 5-7 business days

## Step 6: Add to Approved Vendor List
Once all approvals are complete:
1. Vendor added to IOG approved vendor database
2. Vendor receives welcome packet with:
   - IOG policies and procedures
   - Payment terms and invoice procedures
   - Contact information for key IOG personnel
   - Project-specific requirements
3. Purchase order or contract executed
4. Work can begin

## Step 7: Ongoing Vendor Management
- Quarterly performance reviews for contracts >$50K
- Annual compliance verification (insurance, licenses)
- Prompt payment (Net 30 terms standard)
- Regular communication via designated vendor manager

## Expedited Process
For urgent needs (defined as <2 weeks to start date):
- Contact Andrea Smith immediately
- Provide detailed business justification
- May require executive approval
- Some requirements may be processed in parallel
- Minimum requirements still apply (W-9, insurance)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Vendor doesn't have required insurance
**Solution**: Vendor can purchase COI naming IOG as additional insured, or IOG can assess if lower coverage is acceptable for low-risk engagements

### Issue: International vendor without US tax forms
**Solution**: W-8 form acceptable, but vendor must provide foreign tax documentation and banking details for international wire transfers

### Issue: Urgent need but vendor not onboarded
**Solution**: In exceptional cases, can begin with Limited Services Agreement (LSA) while onboarding completes, with Andrea's approval
