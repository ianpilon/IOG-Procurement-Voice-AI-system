# Payment Terms and Rules

## Fixed Price Contract Payment Rules

### Upfront Payment Limitation
**Maximum 20% upfront payment allowed** on fixed price contracts.

**Exceptions**:

---

### Milestone-Based Payment Structure

#### Required Elements:
All fixed price contracts must have:
- Minimum 3 milestones (maximum 7)
- Clear, measurable deliverables for each milestone
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Timeline for each milestone

####Example Milestone Structure ($150K project):

| Milestone | Deliverable | Amount | % |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---|
| Contract Signing | N/A | $30,000 | 20% |
| Milestone 1 | Requirements complete | $22,500 | 15% |
| Milestone 2 | Design approved | $30,000 | 20% |
| Milestone 3 | Development complete | $37,500 | 25% |
| Final Acceptance | Testing & deployment done | $30,000 | 20% |

**Total**: $150,000 (100%)

### Balloon Payment Rules

**Definition**: A balloon payment is a larger final payment upon project completion.

**Allowed**: Yes, balloon payments are acceptable and often preferred.

**Typical Range**: 30-50% of total contract value

**Benefits**:
- Incentivizes vendor to complete project
- Protects IOG investment
- Aligns with value delivery
- Reduces risk

**Example** ($200K project with balloon):
- 20% ($40K) upfront
- 15% ($30K) at milestone 1
- 15% ($30K) at milestone 2  
- 10% ($20K) at milestone 3
- **40% ($80K) upon final acceptance** ← Balloon Payment

### Not-to-Exceed (NTE) Caps

**Required**: All T&M contracts must have NTE amount

**Monitoring**: Procurement tracks against NTE monthly

**Approaching NTE**:

- IOG decides: authorize increase, reduce scope, or end project
- Requires written approval for any NTE increase

**Example**:
- Estimated effort: 500 hours @ $150/hr = $75K
