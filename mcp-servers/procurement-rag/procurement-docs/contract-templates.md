- Ongoing work or evolving scope? → **Time and Materials Agreement**
- Multiple future projects with same vendor? → **MSA with SOWs**

**Software/Technology**:
- Cloud/SaaS product? → **Software License Agreement**
- Physical hardware? → **Equipment Purchase Agreement**

**Individual Contractor**:
- Single person (not a company)? → **Independent Contractor Agreement**

**Just discussing potential work**:
